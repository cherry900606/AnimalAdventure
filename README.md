# AnimalAdventure

AnimalAdventure is a project for the AR/VR Programming course. In this game, the player controls a unique character called the "animal people" and embarks on an exploration of various scenes. The game features several modes, including "Change Clothes," "Sunny Day," "Rainy Day," and "Coin Game."

In the "Change Clothes" mode, each click of the button triggers a change in the character's accessories.

In the "Sunny Day" and "Rainy Day" modes, the weather changes depending on which button is clicked.

In the "Coin Game" mode, players must collect all ten coins within a given time limit.
